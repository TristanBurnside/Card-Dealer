# Card-Dealer
Sample iOS app using Swift 3 and reactive

This code comes from an internal presentation to Outware employees.

The app is intended to fetch a deck of cards from https://deckofcardsapi.com and deal them out on the screen one-by-one.

Some things that we didn't get to:
1. Create a new deck on startup / whenever the shuffle button is pressed
2. Showing card images on the screen (they currently print to the console)
3. Implement a locally stored alternative to the API
4. Use enums for the card model instead of strings
